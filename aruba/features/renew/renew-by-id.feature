Feature: renew by -id

  As a user
  I want to renew certificates that were enrolled by the app

  Renew action requires a reference to some issued certificate:
     -id
         - for TPP -id is CertificateDN (like in `revoke` command)
         - for Condor -id points to some RequestID, which is used to find ManagedCertificateId then
     -thumbprint
         - for TPP & Condor -thumbprint is used to find CertificateDN / ManagedCertificateId respectively

  Background:
    And the default aruba exit timeout is 180 seconds

  Scenario Outline: TPP - renew by CertificateDN using -id
    Given I enroll random certificate using <endpoint> with -no-prompt -key-file k.pem -cert-file c.pem
    And it should write private key to the file "k.pem"
    And it should write certificate to the file "c.pem"
    And it should output Pickup ID
    And I decode certificate from file "c.pem"
    Then I renew the certificate in <endpoint> using the same Pickup ID with flags -no-prompt -cert-file c1.pem -key-file k1.pem
    And it should retrieve certificate
    And it should write private key to the file "k1.pem"
    And it should write certificate to the file "c1.pem"
    Then private key in "k1.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should have the same modulus
    And certificate in "c.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should not have the same modulus
    And certificate in "c.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should not have the same serial
    Examples:
      | endpoint  |
      | TPP       |
      | Cloud     |


  Scenario Outline: TPP - renew by CertificateDN using -id file:pickup_id.txt
    Given I enroll random certificate using <endpoint> with -no-prompt -pickup-id-file p.txt -cert-file c.pem -key-file k.pem
    And it should retrieve certificate
    And it should write private key to the file "k.pem"
    And it should write certificate to the file "c.pem"
    Then I renew the certificate in <endpoint> with flags -id file:p.txt -no-prompt -cert-file c1.pem -key-file k1.pem -pickup-id-file p1.txt
    And it should retrieve certificate
    And it should write private key to the file "k1.pem"
    And it should write certificate to the file "c1.pem"
    And it should write Pickup ID to the file "p1.txt"
    Then private key in "k1.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should have the same modulus
    And certificate in "c.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should not have the same modulus
    And certificate in "c.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should not have the same serial
    Examples:
      | endpoint  |
      | TPP       |
      | Cloud     |

  Scenario Outline: TPP renew by CertificateDN with -omit-sans
    Given I enroll a random certificate using <endpoint> with -no-prompt -key-file k.pem -cert-file c.pem -san-dns www1.example.com -san-dns www2.example.com
    And it should write private key to the file "k.pem"
    And it should write certificate to the file "c.pem"
    And it should output Pickup ID
    And certificate in "c.pem" should have 3 DNS SANs
    Then I renew the certificate in <endpoint> using the same Pickup ID with flags -no-prompt -cert-file c1.pem -key-file k1.pem -omit-sans
    And it should retrieve certificate
    And it should write private key to the file "k1.pem"
    And it should write certificate to the file "c1.pem"
    And certificate in "c.pem" and certificate in "c1.pem" should not have the same serial
    And certificate in "c1.pem" should have 1 DNS SANs
    Examples:
    | endpoint          |
    | TPPdeprecated     |
