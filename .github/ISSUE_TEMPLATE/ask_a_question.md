about: How can we help you?

---

Please send your questions about setup and general usage to opensource@venafi.com rather
than creating GitHub issues.

The Venafi team is constantly monitoring the opensource@venafi.com inbox so you'll generally
receive a faster response with more detail than if you were to post an issue here on GitHub.
It also allows for you to share information that you might not be comfortable sharing in a
public forum.

Thanks!
